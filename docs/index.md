EPNix
(pronunciation: as if you are high on mushrooms)
enables you to build,
package,
deploy IOCs and other EPICS-related software
by using the [Nix] package manager.

For more information about this approach,
examine {doc}`advantages-disadvantages`.

Before getting started,
make sure to follow the {doc}`prerequisites`.

## Features

### EPICS IOCs

The EPNix IOC framework enables you to you package,
deploy,
and test EPICS IOCs.

To get started,
read the {doc}`IOC tutorials <ioc/tutorials/index>`.

### Other packages

EPNix also packages other EPICS-related tools, such as procServ, or Phoebus.
You can build them by using Nix on any Linux distribution.

For a list of all supported EPICS-related packages, see the {doc}`pkgs/packages`.

### NixOS services

EPNix also provides NixOS modules,
which are instructions
on how to configure various EPICS-related services
on NixOS machines,
such as Archiver Appliance.

To get started,
read the {doc}`NixOS services tutorials <nixos-services/tutorials/index>`

## Release branches

EPNix has a *master* branch,
which is considered unstable,
meaning breaking changes might happen without notice.

EPNix also has release branches,
such as *{{versions.stable}}*,
tied to the nixpkgs release branches,
where breaking changes are forbidden.

Backporting changes to older release branches is done on a "best-effort" basis.
