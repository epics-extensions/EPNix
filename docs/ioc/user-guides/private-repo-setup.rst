Private repository setup
========================

To avoid a great deal of confusion,
it’s best to configure your machine
so that it can clone your private repositories unattended.
This means that this command should succeed
without asking for user input on the terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone 'ssh://git@your.gitlab.com/your/epicsApp.git'

But, asking for user input graphically is acceptable.

The reason is
that the Nix command-line tool often writes text on the terminal,
and does so over the questions asked by programs like SSH or Git.
If SSH or Git asks for a password on the terminal,
you probably won’t see it,
and confusion will follow when the Nix command hangs.

There are two main ways to configure your machine for this:

-  SSH keys
-  GitHub / GitLab tokens

SSH keys
--------

Configuring the SSH key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To set up SSH keys to use with your GitHub account,
you can follow the `GitHub SSH documentation`_.

To set up SSH keys to use with your GitLab account,
you can follow the `GitLab SSH documentation`_,
and particularly look at these sections:

-  See if you have an existing SSH key pair
-  Generate an SSH key pair
-  Add an SSH key to your GitLab account
-  Verify that you can connect

.. _GitHub SSH documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh
.. _GitLab SSH documentation: https://docs.gitlab.com/user/ssh/

Configuring the ssh-agent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have a GNOME installation,
chances are you already have an ssh-agent installed and running.

To check,
open a *new* terminal,
and look at the value of the ``$SSH_AUTH_SOCK`` variable.

If it returns nothing,
install ``gnome-keyring``,
then log out and log in again.

Then reopen a new terminal,
and add your configured SSH key like so:

.. code-block:: bash

   ssh-add 'path/to/key/id_ed25519'

Check that logging in to GitLab doesn’t ask for user input on the terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

   ssh -T 'git@your.gitlab.com'
   # Welcome to GitLab, @user!

If it doesn’t work,
but you have ``gnome-keyring-daemon`` installed and running,
you can add this line to your ``~/.bashrc``:

.. code-block:: bash

   export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/run/user/$UID/keyring/ssh

GitHub / GitLab tokens
----------------------

GitHub and GitLab tokens offer a timed way of authenticating,
suitable for either quick and dirty access,
or for setting up services or scripts
that need access to GitHub / GitLab repositories.
In any case,
tokens shouldn’t be used for usual development.

In GitLab,
you can create tokens either per-user,
per-group,
or per-project.

In GitHub,
you can only create personal access tokens,
but their usage can be restricted in an organization.

Creating a GitHub token,
or a GitLab token for your user means
that you can give it access to all projects and APIs that you have access to.
This can be useful for your personal applications,
or tools like `glab`_.

In GitLab,
you can create a token for given group or project
so that it offers access to that specific group or project.
These kinds of tokens should be preferred.

.. _glab: https://docs.gitlab.com/editor_extensions/gitlab_cli/

GitHub
~~~~~~

To create a GitHub token, follow the `GitHub token documentation`_

.. _GitHub token documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens

GitLab
~~~~~~

.. TODO: reference official documentation

To create a GitLab token,
go to the user/group/project settings,
under the “Access Tokens” section.
Give your token a meaningful name,
an expiration date,
and for a group/project,
select the appropriate role.

If you only want your token to be able to clone repositories,
you can just select the ``read_repository`` scope.
Else refer to GitLab’s official documentation by clicking “Learn more.”

After creating the personal access token,
you can copy the token’s value.
Be careful,
as this value won’t be accessible after closing the page.

If you want to clone any repository,
the URL will need to be:

.. code-block:: bash

   https://gitlab-ci-token:${TOKEN}@your.gitlab.com"

As EPNix uses SSH flake inputs,
you can use this command to instruct Git to rewrite GitLab URLs:

.. code-block:: bash

   git config --global url."https://gitlab-ci-token:${TOKEN}@your.gitlab.com".insteadOf "ssh://git@your.gitlab.com"

To check that your setup is working,
run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone 'ssh://git@your.gitlab.com/your/epicsApp.git'
