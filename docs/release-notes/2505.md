# 25.05 Release notes

```{default-domain} nix
```

## New features

- New module {option}`services.iocs`
  to deploy EPICS IOCs as systemd services.

  If you deployed EPICS IOCs manually by using `systemd.services`,
  or used the configuration {samp}`epnix.nixos.services.{ioc}.config`
  generated from the now deprecated IOC module system,
  read the {doc}`../nixos-services/user-guides/ioc-services` NixOS guide.

## Breaking changes

- The old way of developing IOCs was deprecated,
  and will be removed in version `nixos-26.05`.
  Please follow the migration guide {doc}`../ioc/user-guides/deprecations/migrating-from-modules-development`.

### Phoebus

Phoebus was upgraded from 4.7.x to 5.0.x,
which contains breaking changes:

- The Phoebus client settings are now not persisted on disk.
  This means that for custom settings,
  either:

  - you must always start Phoebus with the `-settings /path/to/settings.ini` option,
  - or you must configure the `settings.ini` file using an EPNix NixOS module (TODO),
  - or you must place the `settings.ini` file in a default location.
    See the [Phoebus Preference Settings] documentation for more information.

- Phoebus save-and-restore now requires authentication
  for all non read-only operations.
  This means that the new option {nix:option}`services.phoebus-save-and-restore.settings."auth.impl"`
  is now required.
  Examine the updated guide {doc}`../nixos-services/user-guides/phoebus-save-and-restore`
  for how to use it.

## Highlights

- Archiver Appliance was upgrade from 1.1.0 -> 2.0.5,
  see the [Archiver Appliance 2.0.5 release notes].
  None of the breaking change should affect users of the
  {option}`services.archiver-appliance` NixOS options.
