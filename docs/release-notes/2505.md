# 25.05 Release notes

```{default-domain} nix
```

## New features

- New module {option}`services.iocs`
  to deploy EPICS IOCs as systemd services.

  If you deployed EPICS IOCs manually by using `systemd.services`,
  or used the configuration {samp}`epnix.nixos.services.{ioc}.config`
  generated from the now deprecated IOC module system,
  read the {doc}`../nixos-services/user-guides/ioc-services` NixOS guide.

## Breaking changes

- The old way of developing IOCs was deprecated,
  and will be removed in version `nixos-26.05`.
  Please follow the migration guide {doc}`../ioc/user-guides/deprecations/migrating-from-modules-development`.

## Highlights

- Archiver Appliance was upgrade from 1.1.0 -> 2.0.5,
  see the [Archiver Appliance 2.0.5 release notes].
  None of the breaking change should affect users of the
  {option}`services.archiver-appliance` NixOS options.

## Documentation

- A revised sidebar,
  with common parts at the top,
  and sections that only apply to different user profiles
- A revised introduction,
  and an explanation of {doc}`../advantages-disadvantages`,
  to better explain the project to newcomers
- New {doc}`../cheatsheet`,
  with links to often used commands and documentation,
  also available in PDF
