# 24.11 Release notes

## Breaking changes

- the {ref}`pkg-support.modbus` support module was upgraded from 3-2 to 3-4,
  which changed the name of the `modbus.dbd` file.
  This file wasn't meant to be used,
  but if you used it by mistake,
  make sure to include `modbusSupport.dbd`,
  and `drvAsynIPPort.dbd` or `drvAsynSerialPort.dbd` instead.
- {nix:option}`services.phoebus-olog` now uses FerretDB instead of MongoDB,
  which prevents having to compile a resource intensive project
  due to its license.
  Migrate your data by following {ref}`mongodb-to-ferretdb`.

## New features

- A new module {nix:option}`programs.phoebus-client` was added
  to install Phoebus and set up Java options.
