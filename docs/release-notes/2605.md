## New features and highlights

### IOC development

- With this release,
  you can pass a function
  as argument to the `mkEpicsPackage` function.
  This means that you can use the [`finalAttrs` pattern],
  for example:

  ```nix
  # ...
  mkEpicsPackage (finalAttrs: {
    pname = "my-package";
    version = "1.0.0";

    src = fetchFromGitHub {
      owner = "my-owner";
      repo = "my-repo";
      rev = finalAttrs.version;
      hash = "...";
    };

    # ...
  })
  ```
